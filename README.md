If you want to add to the errata, you have a couple of options:

* Send me an e-mail (info@martin-thoma.de) - if I don't respond within 3 days,
  just ping me again. I get a lot of messages and if I read it during work I might
  not answer right away. I'm sorry if that happens.
* Add an issue here on GitHub
* Make a Pull Request on Github - that is best, because it makes sure that you
  get credit for your work as well!
